You are given two integer variables x and y. You need to perform the following operations:

p = x + y : Addition
q = x - y : Subtraction
r = x * y :Multiplication
s = x / y : Division
t = x % y : Modulo

Example 1:

Input:
x = 1
y = 2
Output: 
3 -1 2 0 1 
Explanation: The given operations are
performed.
Example 2:

Input:
x = 3 
y = 4 
Output: 
7 -1 12 0 3 
Explanation: The given operations are
performed

Your Task: 
Just complete the mentioned code snippets. The input and output are already done by the given code.

Solution:
// { Driver Code Starts
//Initial Template for C

#include <stdio.h>


 // } Driver Code Ends
//User function Template for C

void utility(int x, int y){
     //Perform addition x+y below
    int p = x+y;
    //Perform subtraction x-y below
    int q = x-y;
    //Perform multiplication x*y below
    int r = x*y;
    //Perform division x/y below
    int s =x/y;
    //Perform modulo operation x%y below
    int t = x%y;

    //The below code prints the output. Don't change it!
    printf("%d %d %d %d %d\n", p, q, r, s, t);
}

// { Driver Code Starts.
    
int main() {
	
	int t; scanf("%d", &t);
	
	while(t--){
	    int x, y;
	    scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
	    utility(x, y);
	}
}  // } Driver Code Ends
