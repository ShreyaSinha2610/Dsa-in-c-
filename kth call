You are given a function utility() which prints count  every time it is called. The function will be called by the driver's code n times.


Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: 1 2 3 4

Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: 1 2

Your Task:
Your task is to declare the variable count such that i is printed when the function is called for the ith call.

Solution:
// { Driver Code Starts
// Initial Template for C++

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


 // } Driver Code Ends
// User function Template for C++

void utility() {

    // declare the variable count 
    static int count = 0;

    // increases the value of count by 1
    count++;

    // print count
    cout << count;
}

// { Driver Code Starts.

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;

    int n;
    cin >> n;

    while (n--) {

        utility();
        cout << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}  // } Driver Code Ends
